# Detect_remote_thread

A kernel driver that detects remote thread creation and dumps the shellcode injected.

Usage:
  - `injection_detection_user.exe 1 PATH` to set the path where the shellcodes are saved.
  - `injection_detection_user.exe 0` to start dumping shellcodes.
  
  
  

NOTE: I will update the code with more comments and a better readme when I have some free time.
